# Social-Big-5-Test
Big 5 personality test, except it's not just you who answer the questions based on what you think about yourself; your friends also answer the same questions, showing what they think of you.

This could possibly be more accurate than the actual Big 5 test? To take an extreme example, a person with Harm OCD would think of themselves in completely the wrong way. Also it could be a fun party game idk

Any person's exact answers for another person will never be shared. Maybe I'll add an option to anonymise your name or something idk
